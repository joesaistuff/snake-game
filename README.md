# Snake Game with Python 🐍🎮

This project was created during the **Prompt Engineering Bootcamp by ZTM**. The goal was to prompt an AI assistant (ChatGPT) to build a classic Snake Game in Python using Pygame. This task was part of learning to construct clear, specific prompts for AI tools.

## Project Overview

The Snake Game is a simple, retro-inspired game where players control a snake to collect food, growing longer with each item consumed. The challenge increases as the snake's length grows, making it harder to avoid collisions with itself or the screen boundaries.

**Features:**
- Visually appealing, dark-themed interface.
- Customizable speed and colors.
- Friendly game-over message: _"Game Over! Womp Womp."_

## Prompts Used to Create the Game

Below are the prompts I used during the development process. These demonstrate how step-by-step instructions were provided to guide the AI in creating the game:

1. **Initial Inquiry**:
   > I would like to make a snake game in Python. Provide the steps necessary.

2. **Implementation Request**:
   > Now go ahead and implement all of these steps with Python code.

3. **Enhancements**:
   > Make the game fancier, use better eye-friendly colors, and update the text to:  
   > "Game Over! Womp Womp. Press Q to quit or C to play again."
